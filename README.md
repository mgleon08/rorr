```

### Topic1: Don't ask me Ruby or Rails

This is to check whether you remember where Ruby ends and Rails.

```ruby
Welcome to "Don't ask me Ruby or Rails"
Let's check whether you remember where Ruby ends and Rails

------------------------------
Question 1 :
------------------------------

Array(foo: :bar)      # => [[:foo, :bar]]

------------------------------
ruby or rails? (Type the ruby or rails to answer, skip to next question, exit to exit)

>
```

### Topic2: What's the return value?

This will show you the several pieces of code. You should type the code returned values to answer.

```ruby
Welcome to "What's the return value?"
Let's check how much do you proficiency in ruby or rails

------------------------------
Question 1 :
------------------------------

1 == 1.0

------------------------------
What's the return value? (Type the Exception or SyntaxError if you expect it will return, skip to next question, exit to exit)

>
```

You can type `Exception` & `SyntaxError` to answer if you expect it will return.


### Topic3: Make all test pass

This will create a rorr directory in your current location where you find a `player.rb` and `README` file.

You can see `README` for instructions and write you answer to `player.rb`.

Type rorr to check if you've finished.

```ruby
Welcome to "Make all tests pass"
Let's check how much do you proficiency in ruby or rails

Question 001 has been generated.
See the ./rorr/normal/001/README for instructions.

When you're done editing player.rb, type the rorr to check, skip to next question, exit to exit

```
